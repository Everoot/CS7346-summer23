# Check your work

You are required to design a cloud-based solution / architecture and be prepared to defend its use during the Presentation Phase. You may safely make assumptions about technologies you don't know well. However, any assumptions you make under this rule must be clearly defined and described during the Presentation Phase.

- Introduction and overview of the kata, the requirements, and your solution
- A discussion of the assumptions you made
- A discussion of the use cases and actors 
- A detailed diagram of the system's architecture
- A list of the [software “-ilities”Links to an external site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) you are considering and their priorities with justifications (Example: [ilities_examples.docx](https://smu.instructure.com/courses/111173/files/7737555?wrap=1)[ Download ilities_examples.docx](https://smu.instructure.com/courses/111173/files/7737555/download?download_frd=1))

* A list of the cloud services employed in your solution with justifications: Why did you choose one service over another? What are the advantages and limitations of the cloud services you used?
* A discussion of the risks and mitigation techniques you will employ (Example: [Lights Please_UseCases_RiskMitigation.pptx](https://smu.instructure.com/courses/111173/files/7737569?wrap=1)[ Download Lights Please_UseCases_RiskMitigation.pptx](https://smu.instructure.com/courses/111173/files/7737569/download?download_frd=1))
* Conclusion
* References
* Include all the references you used at the end of your report on a separate page. Use 1.5-spaced pages and 12pt font size (Calibri (Body)). When you are done, please upload your report as a PDF document (not to exceed 15 pages). For optimum performance, please refer to the rubric often.





## Presentation

During the Presentation Phase, your project team will be doing one of two things, either presenting or listening to other groups' presentations.

If you are presenting, you must...

- Present a vision of your proposal to the rest of the group. Your presentation should be at most 10 minutes long including Q&A.

If you are listening to the other groups, then your job is to ask questions of the project team currently presenting during Q&A.

For this assignment, you will submit a professional presentation that you will utilize in the Presentation Phase. The presentation will offer a summary of your report where you will discuss the kata, your cloud-based architecture, use cases, assumptions, cloud services, risks and mitigation, and so forth. For optimum performance, please refer to the rubric often.
