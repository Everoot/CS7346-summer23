# Introduction Overview

Cloud Computing is a disruptive paradigm that led to changes in areas including: computer science and engineering, including:

* Data Storage
* Computer Architecuture
* Networking
* Resource Management
* Scheduling
* Security



Computing can be viewed as another utility.  

Computer clouds are the utility providing computing services and utility computing 



#### In utility computing

Hardware and software are concentrated in large data centers.



#### The users of computing services pay for 

* Computing
* Storage
* Communication resources



while utility computing often requires a cloud like infrastructure. 

**The focus of cloud computing is on the business model for providing computing services.** The Internet made cloud computing possible. 

**The evolution of cloud computing is organically tied to the future of the Internet** and the years to come. 



The vast computational resources provided by the cloud infrastructure will be used for the design and engineering of complex systems, scientific discovery, education, business, analytics and so forth. 



This module introduces:

* the basic concepts of cloud computing 
* why cloud computing came to be a reality in the last years.
* The defining attributes of computer clouds
* cloud delivery models and services 
* ethical issues
* cloud vulnerabilities
* major cloud players
* vendor lock-in
* the prospects of cloud interoperability
* responsibility sharing
* cloud energy consumption
* ecological impact
* major challenges





### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owing and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services. Organizations of every type, size and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer facing web applications. For example, health care companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are  using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world. With cloud computing your business can become more agile, reduce costs, instantly scale, and deploy globally in minutes. Cloud computing gives you instance access to a broad range of technologies so you can innovate faster and build nearly anything you can imagine, from infrastructure services such as compute, storage and databases, to internet of things, machine learning, data analytics and much more.

You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment and test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences and transform your business, such as adding machine learning and intelligence to your applications in order to personalize experiences for your customers and improve their engagement. 

You don't need to make large, upfront investments in hardware and overpay for capacity you don't use. Instead you can trade capital expense for variable expense and only pay for IT as you consume it. With cloud computing you access resources from the cloud in real time as they're needed. You can scale these resources up and down to grow or shrink capacity instantly as your business needs change. Cloud computing also makes it easy to expand to new regions and deploy globally in minutes. 

For example, Amazon Web Services has infrastructure all over the world, so you're able to deploy your application in multiple physical locations in just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience. No matter your location, size or industry, the cloud frees you from managing infrastructure and data centers so you can focus on what matter most to your business. 



### How Cloud Computing Became a Big Tech Battleground

IBM, Google, Microsoft all are making big bets on cloud computing. That's for good reason. Research firm Gartner forecasts cloud computing revenues to exceed $260 billion dollars in 2020. For years Amazon's AWS led the market. But, that lead is starting to slip as other firms make moves to bolster their cloud computing offerings. In October, Microsoft surprised onlookers when it won the U.S. military's JEDI cloud contract. It could be worth \$10 billion dollars over 10 years. 

In July, IBM spent $34 billion dollars to acquire RedHat and boost it's cloud business.

So why are tech firms going to battle for cloud services? 

Ed Anderson: "Well, and like any market that grows it's strong because it offers a value proposition to people that they find attractive, and so they shift their spending. "



Cloud computing at it's core, is about changing the way businesses manage data. Everything done online; shopping, video, texts it all takes data. The data is processed in behind the scenes computers called servers. Managing that equipment takes time, energy, and money. When a business moves to the cloud it's really just outsourcing. In other words, tech firms like Amazon handle some IT services so businesses can focus on what they do best. Outsourcing IT can generate savings

### Module 1: Wrap-Up

* Number 1 - Cloud computing is a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services.
* Number 2 - Cloud computing resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.
* Number 3 - Cloud computing provides high level abstractions of computation and storage models.
* Number 4 - The defining attributes of cloud computing are: on-demand self service, heterogeneous access, resource pooling, and measured services.
* Number 5 - The main cloud delivery models are: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Database as a Service (DBaaS).
* Number 6 - There are four cloud deployment models: private, public, hybrid, and community.
* Number 7 - Cloud computing risks and challenges include: unauthorized access, data corruption, infrastructure failure, service unavailability, security, vendor lock-in, and resource management.
* Number 8 - The three major cloud players are: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.





### What is an  Availability Zone (AZ)?

* An AZ may be several data centers - counted as 1 AZ when they are a couple of miles of each other.



### What is a Region?

A Region is a geographical area. Each region consists of two (or more) AZs.

#### Check point

The AWS Global Infrastructure comprises Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and Edge Locations, and there is a different number of each infrastructure element. Select the option that shows the correct order from greatest to least.

1. Number of Edge Locations > Number of AZs > Number of Regions âœ…
2. ~~Number of Regions > Number of AZs > Number of Edge Locations~~
3. ~~Number of AZs >  Number of Edge Locations >  Number of Regions~~
4. ~~Number of AZs >  Number of Regions  >  Number of Edge Locations~~
