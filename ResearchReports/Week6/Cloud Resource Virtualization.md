# Cloud Resource Virtualization

Three classes of abstractions describe a computing system operation.

* Interprters
* Memory
* Communication channels



Their respective physical components are

* Processors
* Primary & Secondary memory
* Communications systems



These components have different 

* Bandwidth
* Latency
* Reliability
* Other physical characteristics



Software systems manage these resources and abstract their physical implementations into computer systems capable to process applications.



Virtualization simplifies some resource management tasks.

e.g. The state of a virtual machine running under a hypervisor can be saved and migrated to another server to balance the load.



Virtualization allows users to operate in familiar environments.



This module discusses:

* Virtualization principles
* The motivation for virtualization
* Alternatives for virtualization implementation
* Hardware support for virtualization 
* Kernel-based virtual machines
* Nested virtualization
* Performance degradation due to cache misses
* Open source software platforms for virtualization
* Potential risks
* Virtualization software overview
